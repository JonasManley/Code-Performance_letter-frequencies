# Code-Performance_letter-frequencies

<h2> Assignment :clipboard: </h2> 
In the early days of crypthography analysing the frequency of letters could be used to break an encryption.
_This netbeans project_ reads a file and prints out the frequency of each of the letters in that file.
You need to make it run at least 50% faster than it is now, and should be able to get to around 100% faster.

ATTENTION! _Do not include the the time of print_tally in your analysis or optimizations_
Hand-in:

<h3>Your handin (link on peergrade to project on github) should contain the following:</h3>

* Documentation of the current performance of the program, including why you believe your performance measurements are free of errors.
* An explanation of the bottlenecks in the program.
* A hypothesis of what is causing the problem, and a changed program which is improved to solve the problem.
* Documentation of the new performance, again including documentation that the measurements are free of errors.
* Notice: there might be more than one optimization needed to achieve optimal performance.
