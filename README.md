# Code-Performance_letter-frequencies

<h2> Assignment :clipboard: </h2> 
In the early days of crypthography analysing the frequency of letters could be used to break an encryption.
_This netbeans project_ reads a file and prints out the frequency of each of the letters in that file.
You need to make it run at least 50% faster than it is now, and should be able to get to around 100% faster.

ATTENTION! _Do not include the the time of print_tally in your analysis or optimizations_
Hand-in:

<h3>Your handin (link on peergrade to project on github) should contain the following:</h3>

* Documentation of the current performance of the program, including why you believe your performance measurements are free of errors.
* An explanation of the bottlenecks in the program.
* A hypothesis of what is causing the problem, and a changed program which is improved to solve the problem.
* Documentation of the new performance, again including documentation that the measurements are free of errors.
* Notice: there might be more than one optimization needed to achieve optimal performance.


<h2>Handed in</h2>

1. Clone project to your computer
2. Open the word .doc ("_Perfromance Assignment dokumentation_") and read it. 
3. Open up the project file in a Java IDE of you choosing 
4. Now to get the location of you file "" on your computer. open up the folder, Go "src --> resources --> resources. No copy paste the path including the filename and .txt at the end e.g. 
**My path is**: _C:\Users\Jonas\Documents\GitHub\Code-Performance_letter-frequencies\Project\src\main\resources\FoundationSeries.txt_
5. Paste the path into the main method inside of the project.
6. Run any of the 3 methods and compare your result the the excel ark ("_excel of performance Pre & after modification_") with this repo, to see a comparason between how much hardware effect the result.
